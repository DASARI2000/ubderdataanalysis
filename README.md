DATA ANALYTICS PROJECT
UBER DATA ANALYSIS
Abstract:
Data Analytics has assisted many organizations with enhancing and develop their
exhibition for the many years. Information examination and perception has
helped us with a few advantages, not many of them being recognizing arising
patterns, concentrating on connections and examples in information, examination
top to bottom. This project is all about understanding one such data set of uber
from New York City and is very component to understand the use of data
analytics and visualization. It is produced with the assistance of 'R' programming
language utilizing libraries and packages, for example, ggplot2, lubridate, dplyr
and tidyr. Through projects like this, we can gain knowledge of various complex
operations performed in data visualization. It will empower us to perceive the
examples in information of this gigantic association and gives basic bits of
knowledge of undiscovered data. Additionally guide us in grasping the activities
of various R libraries.

Problem Statement:
Uber is an application-based transportation organization and taxi
organization. In its many rides in a specific city, large numbers of its users face
the problem of cancellation by the driver or non-availability of cars.
These issues influence the matter of Uber and it misses out on its income.
INTRODUCTION:
In the modern world, Uber has emerged as the leading organisation for setting
up new transportation options. People use analytics in their businesses to help it
grow, and this market is one that is rapidly expanding. This project will improve
our understanding of how to use the ggplot2 library to comprehend the data and
to acquire an intuition for comprehending the consumers who benefit from the
travels.
The key to solving this problem is to comprehend customer segmentation.
Customer segmentation can be compared to a child's activity of sorting balls and
cubes based on their colour or shape. Customer segmentation is, to put it simply,
the process of separating customers from the market according to numerous
criteria and categorising them according to different traits. Although the Uber
data is not as granular as the taxi data—unusually, Uber only offers time and
location for pickups, not drop-offs—I nevertheless wanted to offer a dataset that
combined all of the taxi and Uber information that was currently available. Uber
analyses historical data for, say, the past three or four weeks and finds areas of
the city where demand is particularly strong.
To grow business with this competitive environment data analysis is necessary.
Data analysis reports, and other kinds of analysis and report documents must be
developed by businesses so that they can have references for peculiar activities
and undertakings especially when making decisions for the future operations of
the company. The Excel files with the weather data and Uber pick-up data should
be joined together for the analysis. A data analysis can be developed accordingly
if you can arrange all the information based on the activity that you will undergo.
The only transportation service to analyse and communicate actual sustainability
statistics is Uber. Our goal in this R project is to analyse the dataset for Uber
pickups in New York City. This project focuses primarily on data visualisation
and will teach us how to use the ggplot2 library to understand the data and
develop an accurate understanding of the travellers.
Literature review:
Ggplot2 is currently more than 10 years of age and is utilized by 100's of 1000's
of individuals to make a huge number of plots.
It is an R package dedicated to data visualization. It can significantly improve the
quality and feel of your illustrations, and will make you substantially more
efficient in making them. Ggplot2 allows building almost any type of chart. It is
a framework for revelatory making designs, in light of the syntax of illustrations.
You give the information, tell ggplot2 how to plan factors to style, what graphical
primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.
Our main objectives of this project are:
 Visualize the growth of Uber in NYC;
 Analyse the demand based on trends in the time series;
 and calculate the market size for Uber in NYC.
• Additional information on how the service is used;
• An effort to estimate the rise in demand.
Description of Dataset:
The dataset contains information about Uber pickups in New York City from
April 2014 to September 2014. It has over 500k pickups (rows) and the following
4 columns:
Date/Time - The date and time of pickup
Lat - Latitude of pickup
Long - Longitude of pickup Base
Methodology:
Initial Analysis: Understand the dataset given. Look through its structure,
identify the datatypes of various columns and get a basic idea of the dataset to
proceed further.
Data Cleaning: Look out for visible data quality issues and rectify them. Check
for blanks, duplicate data and convert certain columns to required datatypes.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Making use of R, carry out various EDA
operations like Univariate and Segmented Univariate analysis and come up with
intuitive insights of the Supply-Demand problem.
Visualization: Make use of R libraries & package to plot various graphs with
proper aesthetics and geometry, clearly displaying important insights.
Proposed system:
We proposed that we will build a data visualization project with ggplot2 using R
and its libraries. Analyse various parameters like
(a) Trips by the hours in a day’
(b) Trips during months in a year.
At the end create visualizations for different timeframes of the year. Explain how
time affects customer trips.
• Find the days on which each basement has a greater number of active vehicles.
• Can tap growing markets in suburban areas where taxi services are not available.
• The estimated time of arrival can be shortened with an increase in Uber drivers,
which would gradually raise customer satisfaction and increase both the
company's income and drivers' profits. The most popular travel destinations, as
determined by the number of booked trips, will be identified based on the data.
